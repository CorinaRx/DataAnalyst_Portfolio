# Data Analyst Portfolio: Analyzing Mental Health Disorders Dataset

Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio project! In this repository, I'll be sharing my analysis of a dataset that contains information about various mental health disorders. The dataset includes the following columns:

- Index: Unique identifier for each record.
- Entity: Name of the entity (e.g., country, region) the data pertains to.
- Code: Code associated with the entity.
- Year: Year of the data.
- Schizophrenia (%): Prevalence of Schizophrenia.
- Bipolar Disorder (%): Prevalence of Bipolar Disorder.
- Eating Disorders (%): Prevalence of Eating Disorders.
- Anxiety Disorders (%): Prevalence of Anxiety Disorders.
- Drug Use Disorders (%): Prevalence of Drug Use Disorders.
- Depression (%): Prevalence of Depression.
- Alcohol Use Disorders (%): Prevalence of Alcohol Use Disorders.

## Goals of the Analysis

The primary goals of this analysis are to:
- Gain insights into the prevalence of different mental health disorders over time and across different entities.
- Identify trends and patterns in mental health disorder prevalence.
- Explore potential relationships between different disorders.
- Provide visualizations and summaries to effectively communicate the findings.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle.com. It contains data collected from various sources and provides a comprehensive overview of mental health disorder prevalence across different regions and years.

## Analysis Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Creating visualizations such as bar plots, line graphs, and heatmaps to understand the distribution and trends of mental health disorder prevalence.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculating summary statistics, correlations between disorders, and performing hypothesis tests if applicable.
4. **Data Visualization**: Using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create insightful visualizations that effectively convey the analysis results.
5. **Interpretation and Insights**: Summarizing key findings, drawing conclusions, and providing actionable insights based on the analysis.
