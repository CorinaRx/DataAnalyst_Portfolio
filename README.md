## Folder Structure

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle.com. It contains data collected from various sources and provides a comprehensive overview of mental health disorder prevalence across different regions and years.

## Analysis Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Creating visualizations such as bar plots, line graphs, and heatmaps to understand the distribution and trends of mental health disorder prevalence.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculating summary statistics, correlations between disorders, and performing hypothesis tests if applicable.
4. **Data Visualization**: Using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, to create insightful visualizations that effectively convey the analysis results.
5. **Interpretation and Insights**: Summarizing key findings, drawing conclusions, and providing actionable insights based on the analysis.
